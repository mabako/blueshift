-- TUTORIAL
lines[1] = "Hello, My name is Norman Robertson and I will take only 5 minutes of your time to teach you the basics of Roleplaying."
lines[2] = "As you are about to play here, it is important for you to know what Roleplay exactly is."
lines[3] = "Let us first begin with the definition of Roleplaying, to know what it really is."
lines[4] = "In simple terms, Roleplay is playing the role of an imaginary character, but a character who is perfectly human by nature, thoughts and abilities."
lines[5] = "That is, while Roleplaying, your actions must make sense in a realistic manner. When this doesn't happen, it leads to Powergaming."
lines[6] = "Now what is Powergaming? Basically, Powergaming is when you aim to maximise your progress towards a goal by unrealistic means." 
lines[7] = "Here, let me provide you with an example, imagine that I'm being transported by the Police to the Police station.."
lines[8] = "and I certainly don't want to go to the Police station. I have perfectly no chance of escaping the vehicle I'm being transported in,"
lines[9] = "Here, my goal is to escape, and do to so I mysteriously open my hand cuffs, jump out of the vehicle and start running forward towards freedom."
lines[10] = "Now! There is something wrong here, do you know what it is? Yes, the occurance of this event was realistically impossible."
lines[11] = "So, I tried to achieve my goal by unrealistic or impractical means and hence, Powergamed."
lines[12] = "Let us now talk about another important thing, Metagaming."
lines[13] = "Metagaming is the act of unrealistically providing your character with the knowledge of a particular thing."
lines[14] = "This happens when you use Out of Character knowledge, In Character."
lines[15] = "Let me first explain you what is Out of Character (OOC) and In Character (IC)."
lines[16] = "Out of Character refers to the knowledge that you, the person in real possess, and In Character refers to the knowledge that your character in particular, possesses."
lines[17] = "For example, You know that this is a Roleplay server and you are controlling your character, this is OOC knowledge, and this is NOT known by your character."
lines[18] = "Alternatively, your character might know that the person infront of you has a revolver and he/she is about to shoot the person beside him,"
lines[19] = "but you cannot spread this In Character knowledge by Out of Character means, such as by private messaging."
lines[20] = "Now, when you exchange OOC information or IC information between yourself and your character, it is termed as Metagaming."
lines[21] = "Now there are last two very important things you need to know about, Deathmatching and Revenge Killing."
lines[22] = "Deathmatching is the act of killing/harming someone without any realistic Roleplay reason."
lines[23] = "For example, I'm Mister A standing on Main St. and Mister B approaches me, after staring at my face for a while he, without any reason, starts to punch me till I die."
lines[24] = "Now there was no past connection between me and Mister B, we did not even know each other, nor was he contracted to kill me by anyone else with a roleplay reason to kill me."
lines[25] = "Plus, it was quite unrealistic to punch anyone to death in a public place."
lines[26] = "Now, considering Revenge Killing. According to the server rules, if I am killed by someone in a realistic Roleplay manner, I'm supposed to roleplay memory loss."
lines[27] = "When, I decide to ignore this rule and go ahead to kill the man who killed me before in a Roleplay or Non-Roleplay way, I Revenge Kill."
lines[28] = "Alright, so in this class I'm only going to cover these six main things which were extremely vital for you to remember and realise."
lines[29] = "I also want to tell you about certain important things, such as your character name should be like mine, 'Norman Robertson', that is, 'Firstname Lastname'."
lines[30] = "And this is an English speaking server, so you are not allowed to talk to anyone in any other language than English, except in Private Messages. (/pm)"
lines[31] = "Also, you are not allowed to use any forms of hacks or cheats, if caught you will be banned for life. Press F2 In-Game to report any Hackers/Rule violators or request Help."
lines[32] = "So now, it is time for evaluation, I'll be giving you a small test which you MUST pass in order to play here, otherwise you will have to try again."
